        <p>My girlfriends and I planned a long-overdue getaway together and we came across this hotel and booked a 4 day weekend stay.  The atmosphere and quality of everything is to die for.  The staff set us up with every tour we wanted and arranged transportation to each!  Other than the two tours we booked, we barely left the Saffron, and we'd do it all again in a heartbeat! Thanks guys for such a lovely time!  </p>

          <p>I thought all the hype I heard about the hotel was overrated, and that it would be the typical ok but not really worth the price stay.  Boy was I wrong. The moment I walked in I noticed the lighting, decor and smells were amazing! Inviting and warm, and beautifully scented without being overpowering. Honestly, it was just a super experience.  The entire staff exhudes professionalism, class and pleasure to be of service.  A truly lost art to be sure!  Can't wait to book my next visit.  You DO NOT want to skip this stay if you're traveling to the Boston area. </p>i
